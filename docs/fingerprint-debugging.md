# Fingerprint Debugging Notes

Last updated: 2026-05-05 PDT

This file captures practical debugging notes from investigating why
`https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground` reports `developer_tools: true`.

## Local Build

Use the local arm64 macOS build path instead of guess-and-checking in CI:

```sh
source upstream.sh
BUILD_TARGET=macos,arm64 make build
```

The built executable is:

```text
rotunda-150.0.1-beta.25/obj-aarch64-apple-darwin/dist/Rotunda.app/Contents/MacOS/rotunda
```

Launch through the Python/Rotunda path when validating fingerprint behavior.
Directly running the executable can hit profile/config mismatches and is not the
same path that users exercise through Playwright.

## Patch Verification

Before spending time on a Firefox build, run:

```sh
uv run scripts/verify_firefox_patches.py
```

Two important patch-stack rules:

- Patches are applied in sorted order, except roverfox patches are moved last by
  the helper.
- If a patch modifies a file created by another patch, the modifier must sort
  after the creator. For example, a follow-up patch touching
  `js/src/vm/RotundaVMAccessLog.cpp` must sort after
  `vm-access-logging.patch`.

The verifier now allows follow-up patches to touch patch-created files, but the
apply phase still proves whether ordering is correct.

## Current Fingerprint Finding

The first confirmed leak was impossible window geometry.

Before the window-dimension propagation patch, page JS saw values like:

```text
window.outerWidth === window.innerWidth
window.outerHeight === window.innerHeight
```

That is suspicious for a headed desktop browser because browser chrome should
make at least the height differ. The root cause was that the global
`MaskConfig::Profile().getWindow()` fallback was not reliably available in the
content process, while the screen dimensions survived because they were stored
through `RoverfoxStorageManager`.

The fix path is to propagate window dimensions through per-context storage too:

- Add a self-destructing WebIDL setter, `window.setWindowDimensions(...)`.
- Call it from the context init script before page scripts run.
- Have `nsGlobalWindowInner` getters read the per-context values before falling
  back to `MaskConfig`.

After this patch, page JS sees the intended geometry, for example:

```json
{
  "outerHeight": 1080,
  "innerHeight": 1052,
  "outerMinusInnerH": 28,
  "outerWidth": 1920,
  "innerWidth": 1920,
  "screenX": 0,
  "screenY": 0
}
```

Fingerprint still reports `developer_tools: true`, so geometry propagation was a
real leak but not the whole detection signal.

The next confirmed inconsistent state was the available-screen rectangle. The
window path was fixed, but `screen.availTop` and `screen.availHeight` still came
from the host/default path:

```json
{
  "screen": {
    "height": 900,
    "availTop": 25,
    "availHeight": 875
  },
  "window": {
    "screenY": 0,
    "outerHeight": 900
  }
}
```

That says the desktop available area starts below the macOS menu bar, while the
browser window starts at y=0 and occupies the full physical screen height. Treat
`screen.*`, `screen.avail*`, and `window.*` as one coherent geometry tuple; do
not spoof only part of it.

For macOS fingerprints, normalization should clamp the window to the available
screen rectangle:

- `screen.availLeft <= window.screenX`
- `screen.availTop <= window.screenY`
- `window.outerWidth <= screen.availWidth`
- `window.outerHeight <= screen.availHeight`
- `window.screenY + window.outerHeight <= screen.availTop + screen.availHeight`

## Developer Tools Finding

The remaining `developer_tools: true` signal came from Firefox async stack
capture, not from the classic console-object getter probe.

The Fingerprint agent includes a Firefox/Safari/Chrome devtools probe that
passes a DOM node with an `id` getter to `console.debug`, but its own collected
request showed this probe skipped on Firefox:

```json
{
  "s163": {
    "s": -1,
    "v": null
  }
}
```

The decisive signal was the agent's error-trace source. It throws an exception
and sends `Error.stack` as a raw device attribute. With Playwright/Juggler
attached, Firefox treats the page global as a `Debugger` debuggee, so the stack
contains async parent frames such as `promise callback*...` and `async*...`.
Fingerprint classifies that as developer tools/debugger state.

The A/B test used the same local executable and same launch path:

```text
baseline:                         developer_tools: true,  suspect_score: 9
javascript.options.asyncstack=0:  developer_tools: false, suspect_score: 0
```

The launcher default should set `javascript.options.asyncstack` to `false`.
Callers can still override it explicitly through `firefox_user_prefs`, but the
default should match a normal non-debugged page where async debugger stack
capture is not visible to page JavaScript.

## PixelScan Masking Finding

PixelScan's `Fingerprint: Masking detected` verdict can be triggered by
synthetic font metrics. The C++ font-spacing patch already treats
`fonts.spacingSeed == 0` as a no-op, but the Python defaults previously filled a
missing spacing seed with a random nonzero value. That made ordinary Rotunda
launches perturb HarfBuzz glyph advances and produce font/canvas text metrics
that do not match real population data.

The default should leave `fonts.spacingSeed` at `0`. Explicit nonzero seeds are
still useful for A/B tests, but should be opt-in.

When debugging this, make sure the `.app` bundle is actually running the current
`XUL`. An incremental `gfx/thebes` build updates `dist/bin/XUL`, but the
previous app bundle can continue using stale font-spacing code. Rebuild/link the
library and refresh the app copy before retesting:

```sh
cd rotunda-150.0.1-beta.25
./mach build --allow-subdirectory-build gfx/thebes layout/generic toolkit/library
cp obj-aarch64-apple-darwin/dist/bin/XUL \
  obj-aarch64-apple-darwin/dist/Rotunda.app/Contents/MacOS/XUL
```

PixelScan's font check is a 160-family canvas probe. Stock Firefox on this host
produces 147 unique canvas outputs with one expected STIX/Times duplicate group.
The stale Rotunda app produced only 133 unique outputs and several extra
duplicate groups. After refreshing `XUL`, Rotunda matched stock Firefox:

```text
/s/api/co: osFontsStatus=true
/s/api/cb: result=true
page: Your Browser Fingerprint is consistent / No masking detected
```

The font allowlist aliases are still useful. PixelScan's expected macOS list
contains legacy/CoreText family names, and regular Firefox resolves those names
on the same host. Rotunda should allow those aliases through `setFontList()` so
Firefox's native resolver can handle them.

The fix is Python-side allowlist alias support: keep discovered font families
and allowlist-only aliases separate internally, then merge both into the final
`fonts.families` list that `setFontList()` receives. Do not add C++ family
substitutions for this case; that changes resolver behavior instead of letting
stock Firefox resolve the same aliases it normally accepts.

One more PixelScan mismatch can hide in the Python context path. `launch_options`
may build a Firefox 150 user agent, but `NewContext(browser, fingerprint=fp)`
used to preserve the BrowserForge skeleton's original Firefox version unless
`ff_version` was passed again. Derive the major version from the launched
Playwright browser when `ff_version` is omitted, so HTTP and navigator versions
stay aligned with the executable.

## VM Access Logger

The VM logger is controlled by environment variables:

```sh
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_FILTER='fingerprint'
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_OBJECT_FILTER='Window'
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_SYMBOLS=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_RETURNS=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_BUFFERED=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_REALM=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_VALUE_STRINGS=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_FUNCTION_NAMES=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_SAMPLE_RATE=1
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_MAX_ARGS=8
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_MAX_STRING=256
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_MAX_QUEUE_BYTES=67108864
```

Under Playwright, browser stderr is not reliably visible from the Python launch
path. Prefer logging directly to a file:

```sh
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG=1 \
ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG_FILE=/tmp/rotunda-fp-vm.log \
PYTHONPATH=pythonlib \
.venv/bin/python scripts_or_inline_repro.py
```

Useful filters:

- Use `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_OBJECT_FILTER=Window` for global/window probes.
- Use `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_OBJECT_FILTER=Navigator` for navigator probes.
- Use no object filter for a full run, but expect very large logs.
- Script URL filters can be brittle because the Fingerprint script URL changes
  and minified code may be loaded through different bundle URLs.

The logger records:

- Property gets and `in` checks.
- `getOwnPropertyDescriptor`.
- `ownKeys`.
- Native and scripted calls, including callee name, `this` class, and capped
  argument previews.
- Return previews for calls, property gets, and `in` checks when
  `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_RETURNS=1`.
- String return/argument contents only when
  `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_VALUE_STRINGS=1`; otherwise strings are logged as the
  cheaper `<string>` marker.
- Native caller and target realm attribution when `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_REALM=1`,
  which usually identifies both the script owner and the page/frame/global owner
  of the object being inspected without adding page-visible wrappers.

When `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG_FILE` is set, the logger uses a native buffered
writer thread by default. The JS execution thread records compact structured
events with interned string ids and primitive previews; the writer thread formats
the grep-friendly text lines. Set `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_BUFFERED=0` only when
debugging the logger itself. If a full unfiltered run outpaces the writer,
overflow is reported as
`op=log-dropped ... reason=queue-full`; raise
`ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_MAX_QUEUE_BYTES` for short local sessions where completeness
matters more than memory.
Use `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_SAMPLE_RATE=N` to record roughly every Nth VM event when
the full stream still changes page timing too much. Use
`ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_FUNCTION_NAMES=0` if function-name lookup itself becomes a
hot-path cost; object value previews still report class names either way.

## Debug Dump Mode

This debugging session would have been much shorter with one reproducible dump
directory containing the browser identity, network traffic, VM accesses, and
selected high-value API outputs. The Python launch/context path now supports
this small env-flag surface:

```sh
ROTUNDA_DEBUG_DUMP_DIR=/tmp/rotunda-debug
ROTUNDA_DEBUG_DUMP=manifest,network,console,vm,returns
ROTUNDA_DEBUG_DUMP_MAX_BODY=1048576
```

Set `ROTUNDA_DEBUG_DUMP_RAW=1` only for isolated local repros where secrets are
not a concern. Without raw mode, obvious credentials in headers and common token
strings are redacted.
The `returns` section implies `vm` because native return previews are emitted by
the VM access logger.
Do not implement dump collection by replacing or wrapping page-visible
JavaScript APIs. Anything injected into the page realm changes function identity,
property descriptors, stack traces, or timing and is itself fingerprintable.

The dump is JSONL-first so normal shell tools work:

- `manifest.json`: executable path, `browser.version`, generated UA, context UA,
  Firefox prefs, config payload, `dist/bin/XUL` hash, app-bundle `XUL` hash, and
  mtimes. This would have caught the stale `.app` `XUL` problem immediately.
- `network.jsonl`: request id, frame URL, method, URL, request headers, posted
  body, status, response headers, response body, timing, and redirect chain.
  PixelScan's `/s/api/co` response explicitly exposed `osFontsStatus:false`, so
  response-body capture is as important as request capture.
- `console.jsonl`: console method, arguments, stack/script URL when available,
  page errors, and uncaught exceptions. This should capture debug output from
  patched third-party agents without relying on browser stderr.
- `vm-access.log`: the existing native VM property/call records. When `vm` is
  enabled, the Python launcher automatically sets `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG=1` and
  points `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_LOG_FILE` at this file. It also enables the native
  buffered writer and realm attribution. When `returns` is enabled, it sets
  `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_RETURNS=1`, which adds return-preview lines for
  native/scripted calls plus property `get` and `in` checks. Set
  `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_VALUE_STRINGS=1` for investigations where actual string
  values such as `Error.stack` matter more than timing fidelity.

Network logging and return logging solve different problems and both are needed:

- Network dumps show the server verdict and often name the failed check directly
  (`developer_tools`, `osFontsStatus`, `result:false`).
- VM return dumps show what page JavaScript actually observed before it built or
  encrypted a payload, such as `Error.stack`, `navigator.userAgent`,
  `screen.availHeight`, canvas hashes, or font probe measurements. Actual
  string contents require `ROTUNDA_VM_ACCESS_VALUE_STRINGS=1`; numbers,
  booleans, object classes, and error markers are captured without that flag.
- Native surface-specific summaries would keep logs grepable when generic VM
  logging produces too much data or enormous binary strings.

Implemented:

- Add a Python-side network dump hook for all `NewContext`/`AsyncNewContext`
  contexts when `ROTUNDA_DEBUG_DUMP` includes `network`.
- Add console and page-error dumps for pages created from a debug-dump context.
- Automatically route existing native VM logs into the dump directory when `vm`
  is enabled.
- Add native return previews for calls, property gets, and `in` checks when
  `returns` is enabled.
- Move native VM file writes and flushes to a buffered writer thread, with a
  bounded queue and explicit drop markers on overflow.
- Move VM line formatting to the native writer thread by queueing compact
  structured events, with interned strings, capped call arguments, optional
  string-value capture, and event sampling.
- Add caller and target realm-name attribution to VM lines so script reads can
  be tied back to the native frame/global owner without page-context
  instrumentation.
- Add body-size limits, binary hashing, and default redaction for `Cookie`,
  `Authorization`, proxy credentials, and bearer-like strings. Provide an
  explicit raw mode for isolated local repros.

Remaining TODOs:

- Convert native VM logs to JSONL and include stable browsing context id, user
  context id, frame id, frame URL, and script URL where those are available.
  Caller and target realm names are useful attribution now, but they are not a
  complete frame identity model.
- Add native-only surface logs for fingerprint-heavy APIs: canvas, fonts, WebGL,
  AudioContext, WebRTC, screen/window, navigator, timezone/locale, and
  `Error.stack`. These must be below the page JS layer, not wrappers installed
  with `add_init_script`.
- Use a single monotonically increasing event id across manifest, network, VM,
  console, and surface logs so a request can be correlated with the JS reads and
  calls that produced it. The Python JSONL files have per-writer event ids
  today; native VM logs and cross-process coordination do not.
- Include a one-command repro harness that launches a URL, waits for network
  idle or a selector, writes the dump, and exits cleanly.

## Repro Harness

Use a shared BrowserForge fingerprint for browser launch and context creation.
This avoids creating mismatched launch/context identities:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

from rotunda import Rotunda, NewContext
from rotunda.fingerprints import generate_fingerprint

exe = Path(
    "rotunda-150.0.1-beta.25/"
    "obj-aarch64-apple-darwin/dist/Rotunda.app/Contents/MacOS/rotunda"
).resolve()

fp = generate_fingerprint(debug=True)

with Rotunda(
    headless=False,
    executable_path=str(exe),
    fingerprint=fp,
    ff_version=150,
    i_know_what_im_doing=True,
    env=os.environ.copy(),
    config={"showcursor": False},
) as browser:
    context = NewContext(browser, fingerprint=fp, ff_version="150", debug=True)
    page = context.new_page()
    page.goto("https://demo.fingerprint.com/playground", wait_until="domcontentloaded")
    page.wait_for_function(
        "document.body && /developer_tools|Developer Tools/.test(document.body.innerText)"
    )
```

## Noise To Ignore

The playground regularly emits these console errors in our runs:

- `Cookie "__cf_bm" has been rejected for invalid domain.`
- CORS failures to `metric.fingerprinthub.com`.

These happen alongside successful Fingerprint API responses and are not the
primary `developer_tools` signal.

## Request Payload Debugging

To see the pre-encrypted Fingerprint request, fetch the current agent script and
route the page to a patched copy where the internal logger is forced on:

```sh
curl -L --compressed -sS \
  'https://demo.fingerprint.com/DBqbMN7zXxwl4Ei8/web/v4/ahNo3Idb3RiQg69bQglE?ci=jsl/4.0.0' \
  -o /tmp/fpjs-pro-current.js
```

Then replace this minified condition before fulfilling the request:

```python
patched = agent.replace("RT()&&$O()", "$O()")
```

The page console will include `[Fingerprint] Visitor id request` with the raw
source keys and values. This was how `s163` was ruled out and the async
`Error.stack` payload was identified.
